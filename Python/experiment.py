1. For you to print a string must enclose the string in quotation marks otherwise it throws error,
print(hello)  #error
Output: Error
print("hello")  #correct
Output: hello

2.You can do addition and print the result without storing in variable
print(60+5)
Output: 65

# 3.When declaring variable no need of specifying the type of data to be stored 
# in that variable. When you print the variable the output will be what is in it
n="hello"
print(n)
Output: hello
