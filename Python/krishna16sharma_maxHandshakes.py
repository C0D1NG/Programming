"""To get the maximum number of handshakes a person would have to shake hands
    with every other person. So the first person would have N-1 people to shake
    hands with. The next person would have N-2(since he already shook hands
    with the first one.
    It is easy to see the pattern here.
    Total number of handshake = N-1 + N-2 +â€¦.+ 1 + 0
    This is just ((N-1)*N/2)
    Complexity : O(1)"""
